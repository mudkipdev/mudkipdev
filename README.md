Hey there! My name is mudkip, I am a young developer from the United States trying to learn about software development and open source.

Iâ€™m currently working on [Umbreon](https://github.com/mudkipdev/umbreon), an open-source Discord bot for many different purposes such as moderation and games! My website ([mudkip.dev](https://mudkip.dev)) is also currently in progress.

### ðŸŒ± Learning
Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Go.
